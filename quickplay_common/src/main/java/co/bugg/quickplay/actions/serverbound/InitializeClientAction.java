/**
 * ID: 25
 * Received by the server when the client first initializes the socket. Intended to send client metadata.
 *
 * As an attempt to make porting Quickplay to other clients as easy as possible, only the first four payload items
 * are required. If you are a third party implementing Quickplay into your client, the other items may not be
 * relevant to your client, or your implementation or legal obligations may vary, rendering them difficult or
 * impossible to include. Additionally, they are not relevant to the Quickplay backend, but instead are used
 * to target a better user experience, debug issues, and gather user analytics.
 *
 * On the other hand, the client ID, user agent, Quickplay version, and Minecraft language ARE required. The
 * Quickplay backend uses these items to determine what actions to send to the user, and what those actions should
 * contain in their payload. If these items are not included, the socket connection will be disconnected. If they are
 * not accurate, the user could receive actions which they should not receive, which could result in incorrect
 * buttons/translations or, at worst, client crashes/errors.
 *
 * If a client ID is not relevant to your client (e.g. your client only supports anonymous mode), submit an empty
 * string. If you are not sure what your Quickplay user agent should be, it does not matter as long as you are
 * confident that it is unique to your client. If you are not sure what your Quickplay version should be, use the
 * version of Quickplay from which you are porting. If this is not relevant (e.g. you are developing a web portal), you
 * can tell the backend to ignore this by proving an empty value. If a Minecraft language is not relevant to your
 * client, use the default language of your client or "en_us".
 *
 * Payload Order:
 * Identifier - This is the unique identifier of this user, such as their UUID in Minecraft or their email in the browser.
 * Identifier type (GOOGLE or MOJANG)
 * User agent - This is the name of the client which the user is using.
 * Quickplay version
 * Minecraft language
 * Minecraft version
 * Client version - This is the version of the user agent, e.g. for Forge, it'd be the Forge version.
